# Better Status Bar

I hate how Chrome's status bar doesn't show you the entire url. So here is my
fix for it.

This userscript will display another status bar in the top left corner of the
screen.

## Known Issues
- The status bar displays on the top left, not the bottom left.
- The original Chrome status bar is still displayed.
